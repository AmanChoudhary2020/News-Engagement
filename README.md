# News-Engagement
News organizations often turn to social media to share their stories, in order to reach a wide swath of readers quickly. While useful, social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit also attract unproductive discussions that may detract from the news story, such as jokes about the news story's headline that don't engage with the article content. News organizations therefore often need a way to find engaging comments automatically, to better understand how their readership is reacting to their stories.

This project will provide an in-depth linguistic analysis of questions and comments posed to news stories on social media, with the goal of helping news organizations anticipate the information needs of their audience. This will consist of collecting social media data related to several major news organizations, labeling the data according to level of engagement, and developing machine learning methods to predict comment engagement based on the text of the news article and the headline.
